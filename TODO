Lots of stuff todo...  here are a few big items:

-	convert to using curses (or similar, perhaps)
-	make the clock stamps cleaner when using large -i values
-	write a man page

Also, see http://www.daveltd.com/src/util/ttyload/ for other
stuff that may be on my list.

And some small stuff:

- add color to load numbers at the top of the screen
- add an option to suppress the Legend
