Lots of stuff todo...  here are a few big items:

- convert to using an MVC-like structure of things, to make it much
  easier in the future to create curses and/or other (OpenGL? ;)
  front-ends.
- once that's done, right a curses (or similar) front-end
- make the clock stamps cleaner when using large -i values

Also, see http://www.daveltd.com/src/util/ttyload/ for other
stuff that may be on my list.
