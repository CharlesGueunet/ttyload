This code is still in relative infancy, despite the
chronological age of some of it...  As such, I suspect the
potential is pretty high that there are a number of bugs in it.
There are also a number of features which I'd like to be in it,
but which currently are not...  I suppose I could call those
bugs too, maybe, but instead I'll reference them in a different
list, presented in the file named TODO.  And currently, while
I've got plenty of things I want to see changed, there's not
much that I can really call a "bug", per se...  But here's
something that's at least borderline on being one:

-	actually detect, rather than hard-coding, the number of
	rows and columns on the tty this is being run on.
